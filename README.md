# IPL_INSIGHT

This is an  IPL Win Predictor application, a machine learning model that could predict with fairly good accuracy whether or not a team is likely to win during the second innings of an IPL cricket game. The predictor applies logistic regression-a most commonly used statistical analysis for binary classification- for the analysis of six critical game parameters: the batting team, bowling team, overs completed, target runs, wickets down, and match venue. It does so with the help of historical data of the IPL to grasp patterns as well as relationships between such parameters to calculate real-time chances of both teams winning as the game unfolds.

The project will deliver real-time data-driven insights about the probable outcome of a match, enriching the viewing experience. The same model can be used for sports analysts and strategists so that its predictions would avail to understand the various impacts different game conditions and strategies would have.

Results show that the model is able to clearly identify game dynamics, though at its current state, there is scope to enhance the precision with additional parameters, advanced modeling methods, and a larger dataset. Consequently, the project will open new ways of engaging audiences and deepen the understanding of cricket match progression by demonstrating the potential of machine learning in sports analytics.
